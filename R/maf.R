# Min/Max Autocorrelation Factors (MAF) in time (or 1D)
# EU program Fisboat, DG-Fish, STREP n? 502572
# Authors : M.Woillez, J. Rivoirard, Mines-ParisTech
# Last update : 01 march 2008
#
# Description:
# The MAF are a multivariate statistical method, that allows the set of
# initial variables to be decomposed into factors. The autocorrelation of
# which decreases, or the variogram increases, when going from the first
# factors to the last ones. Hence the very first factors extract the part of
# the variables which is the most continuous in time.
#
# Details:
# The present routine makes twice use of PCA. Here 'prcomp' is used for PCA
# instead of 'princomp', as it allows less samples (e.g. years) than variables.
# After original variables are turned into normalized PC, MAF are obtained as
# the PC of their increments; their order is then reversed to begin with the
# smallest variograms (i.e. the half variances of increments).
#
# Note:
# The number of MAF cannot exceed the number of variables, nor the number of
# year increments (number of sampled years - 1). If the number of variables
# tends to be larger than the number of sampled years, the MAF no.i (i=1, ...)
# tends to have period (nb years - 1)*2/i. In particular there will be
# evidence of a high continuity with period (nb years -1)*2 for MAF1,
# (nb years -1) for MAF2, etc, whatever the data, which may not be significant
# out of this series e.g. for additional years. The number of variables should
# then be better reduced well below the number of sampled years.
#
# Inputs:        
#   formula   A formula with no response variable, referring only 
#             to numeric variables.
