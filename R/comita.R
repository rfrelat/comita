#' @title Comparative tools for Ecosystem Integrative Trend Analysis
#' @description 
#' Integrated trend analyses (ITA) are commonly applied to summarise changes that have 
#' occurred in recent decades in ecosystems. Currently there are multiple methods used 
#' for ITA, raising question on which is the best method to use for ITA. The aim of this 
#' application is to provide a tool to easily compare different ITA methods, and test 
#' the effect of data pre-processing and variables selection on the final results. 
#' Hopefully, this package will raise awareness of ecologists to different dimension 
#' reduction techniques, as well as provide reason and confidence on the choice of ITA 
#' methods according to the characteristics of their dataset.
